## Project Identity

**Name:** RendMD  
**Tagline:** *Intelligent. Elegant. Your data. Open source.*  
**Positioning:** The thinking person's markdown editor.

## Project Philosophy

> **"Make markdown a more accessible format for the everyday writer, developer, or anyone who uses a computer, in an elegant open source package."**

---

## 2026-01-29 - Project Inception

### Context
Started RendMD project - a rendered-first markdown editor. The goal is to edit markdown documents from their beautifully rendered state rather than editing raw source, while maintaining clean markdown file output.

**Tagline:** *Intelligent. Elegant. Your data. Open source.*  
**Positioning:** The thinking person's markdown editor.

### Initial Competitive Analysis

| Product | Rendered-First | True MD | Open Source | AI | Premium UX | Free |
|---------|---------------|---------|-------------|-----|------------|------|
| Typora | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ ($15) |
| Notion | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Freemium |
| Obsidian | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | 🔌 Plugin | ✅ | ⚠️ Freemium |
| Milkdown | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| **RendMD** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (v1.1) | ✅ (goal) | ✅ |

**Gap identified:** No open source, rendered-first editor with AI assistance exists.

### Key Decisions Made

---

#### ADR-001: Rendered-First Editing Paradigm
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:** Most markdown editors are either source-focused (edit raw MD, see preview) or fully WYSIWYG (no markdown output). We want both: visual editing with markdown file output.

**Decision:** Build a "rendered-first" editor where the rendered view is the primary editing surface, but all content is stored as standard markdown.

**Rationale:**
- Preserves markdown portability (files work everywhere)
- Eliminates context-switching between source/preview
- More approachable for non-technical users
- Aligns with philosophy of making markdown accessible to everyone
- Unique positioning in the market

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Better UX than split-pane editors
- ✅ Files remain portable
- ✅ Lowers barrier to entry for markdown
- ⚠️ Requires robust markdown round-trip logic
- ⚠️ Some advanced markdown users may want source view (mitigated: adding toggle)

---

#### ADR-002: Technology Stack Selection
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:** Need to choose frontend framework, editor library, and supporting tools.

**Decision:** 
- React 18 + TypeScript
- TipTap (ProseMirror-based) for editor
- Tailwind CSS + CSS variables for styling
- Vite for build tooling
- Zustand for state management
- Shiki for code highlighting

**Rationale:**
- TipTap has proven markdown import/export capabilities
- React ecosystem is mature for this type of application
- Tailwind enables rapid development while CSS variables allow theming
- Zustand is minimal overhead vs Redux/MobX
- Shiki provides accurate, theme-aware syntax highlighting

**Alternatives Considered:**
| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| Svelte | Lighter, less boilerplate | Less editor tooling | Rejected |
| Milkdown | Markdown-focused | Less mature | Consider for future |
| Vue | Good ecosystem | Less familiar | Rejected |
| CodeMirror | Great for code | Less rich-text focused | Rejected |

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Large ecosystem of examples and solutions
- ✅ Type safety from TypeScript
- ⚠️ React bundle size (acceptable for desktop/local app)
- ⚠️ Learning curve for TipTap/ProseMirror internals

---

#### ADR-003: Four-Theme Priority Order
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:** User wants four themes: dark basic, light basic, dark glass, light glass.

**Decision:** Development order:
1. Dark basic (primary development theme)
2. Light basic
3. Dark glassmorphism
4. Light glassmorphism

**Rationale:**
- Dark theme is developer-friendly for long coding sessions
- Basic themes establish core design system before adding effects
- Glass themes are enhancement layer on top of basic foundations
- This order minimizes rework

---

#### ADR-004: Source View Toggle
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:** Should users be able to see/edit raw markdown source?

**Decision:** Yes, include a source view toggle. Hidden by default, accessible via button or Ctrl+/.

**Rationale:**
- Power users expect to see/verify source
- Useful for debugging rendering issues
- Educational for users learning markdown
- Hidden by default maintains rendered-first philosophy

**Implementation Notes:**
- Side panel layout (not bottom, to preserve reading flow)
- Read-only by default (editing source directly adds complexity)
- Synced scrolling optional enhancement

---

#### ADR-005: Image Handling Strategy
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:** When users add images, should they be stored locally or referenced by URL?

**Decision:** Support both options. When user adds an image, prompt them to choose:
1. Store locally in `./assets/` folder (relative path)
2. Reference external URL

**Rationale:**
- Local storage ensures portability and offline access
- URL reference is lighter weight and works for web images
- User choice respects different workflows
- No one-size-fits-all solution exists

**Implementation Notes:**
- Create `assets/` folder on first local image save
- Generate unique filenames (timestamp or hash prefix)
- Relative paths for portability

---

#### ADR-006: Frontmatter Support
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:** Should we support YAML frontmatter blocks for document metadata?

**Decision:** Yes, with a dedicated UI panel (not just raw YAML editing).

**Rationale:**
- Frontmatter is standard in static site generators, documentation tools
- Form-based UI makes metadata accessible to non-technical users
- Can enable features like per-document theme override
- Aligns with accessibility philosophy

**Implementation Notes:**
- Parse YAML on file load, separate from content
- Display as collapsible form panel above document
- Common fields: title, author, date, tags, theme
- Support custom key-value pairs
- Serialize back to YAML on save

---

### Research Notes

**TipTap Markdown Ecosystem:**
- `@tiptap/extension-markdown` - Official but basic
- `tiptap-markdown` - Community extension with more features
- May need custom serializer rules for edge cases (tables, nested lists)
- Round-trip testing critical before committing to approach

**File System Access API:**
- Supported in Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
- NOT supported in Firefox or Safari
- Fallback strategy:
  - Open: `<input type="file" accept=".md">`
  - Save: Create blob, trigger download
  - Less elegant but functional
- Can request persistent permissions (user grants once)

**Glassmorphism Implementation:**
- Core CSS: `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` + semi-transparent background
- GPU-accelerated in modern browsers
- Firefox: `backdrop-filter` now supported (was behind flag until 2023)
- Safari: Full support with `-webkit-` prefix
- Performance considerations:
  - Avoid animating blur values
  - `will-change: backdrop-filter` for performance hints
  - Limit glass layers (don't stack multiple blurs)

**Frontmatter Parsing:**
- Use `yaml` package from npm (formerly `js-yaml`)
- Detect frontmatter by `---` delimiters at file start
- Regex: `/^---\n([\s\S]*?)\n---/`
- Handle edge cases: empty frontmatter, invalid YAML

### Open Questions (Resolved)

| Question | Resolution | Date |
|----------|------------|------|
| Source view toggle? | Yes, hidden by default | 2026-01-29 |
| Image handling | Support both URL and local | 2026-01-29 |
| Frontmatter support | Yes, with form UI | 2026-01-29 |

### Open Questions (Pending)

| Question | Options | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| License choice | MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL | Need to decide before public release |
| Project hosting | GitHub, GitLab, self-hosted | GitHub likely for community |
| Error telemetry | None, opt-in, opt-out | Privacy considerations |
| AI default provider | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, none | For v1.1, need to pick sensible default |

---

#### ADR-007: Source View is Editable
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:** Should the source view be read-only or editable?

**Decision:** Source view is fully editable with bidirectional sync. All editing tools (toolbar, shortcuts) work in both rendered and source views.

**Rationale:**
- Power users expect to edit source directly
- Limiting to read-only feels arbitrary
- Bidirectional editing is more flexible
- Aligns with accessibility philosophy (multiple ways to edit)

**Consequences:**
- ✅ More powerful for advanced users
- ✅ Familiar to traditional markdown editor users  
- ⚠️ More complex sync logic required
- ⚠️ Need to handle conflicting edits gracefully

---

#### ADR-008: AI Assistance Feature (Stretch Goal → v1.1 Target)
**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:** Should RendMD include AI writing assistance? This is a potential key differentiator.

**Decision:** Plan for AI assistance as a v1.1 feature, using BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model.

**Rationale:**
- **Differentiation:** No open source rendered-first editor has native AI
- **No backend cost:** User provides their own API key
- **Privacy-first:** Keys stored locally, encrypted; direct API calls
- **Inspired by Notion AI** but without vendor lock-in
- Aligns with philosophy of making markdown accessible

**Planned Providers:**
- OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Haiku)
- Google (Gemini Pro, Flash)
- Ollama (local models - fully private option)
- OpenRouter (aggregator)

**Planned Features:**
- Continue writing / autocomplete
- Improve writing (grammar, clarity, tone)
- Summarize selection or document
- Expand on a point
- Translate to other languages
- Custom prompts

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Major differentiator in the market
- ✅ No server costs (BYOK model)
- ✅ Supports local AI (Ollama) for privacy
- ⚠️ Additional complexity
- ⚠️ Must handle API errors gracefully
- ⚠️ User education needed for API key management

---

#### ADR-009: Feature Philosophy - Strategically Complete
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:** In a saturated market, should RendMD be feature-dense (like Obsidian) or minimal (like a simple text editor)?

**Decision:** Neither. Be "strategically complete" - flawless core + key differentiators + extensibility foundation.

**Tiered Approach:**
| Tier | Version | Focus |
|------|---------|-------|
| Core | v1.0 | Editing, themes, files, navigation - must be flawless |
| Power | v1.x | AI assistance, advanced export - differentiators |
| Extensible | v2.0 | Plugin API, community themes - ecosystem |

**Rationale:**
- Minimal is hard to differentiate (many simple editors exist)
- Feature-dense risks bloat and maintenance burden
- Strategic features that matter > many features that don't
- AI is the right differentiator because no competitor has it in this space

**Value Proposition:**
> "Notion's intelligence. Typora's elegance. Your data. Open source."

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Clear product identity
- ✅ Focused development effort
- ✅ Room to grow without bloat
- ⚠️ Must resist scope creep in v1.0
- ⚠️ AI feature is a commitment

### Key Decisions Made

---

#### ADR-010: Markdown Round-Trip Testing Strategy
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:** Markdown round-trip fidelity is core to product identity. We need to validate tiptap-markdown before building features on top of it.

**Decision:** Create Phase 0.5 focused on validation and debugging infrastructure.

**Testing Strategy:**

1. **Test Data Generation**
   - Create `tests/fixtures/markdown-test-suite.md` with:
     - All GFM elements (headings, lists, tables, code, links, images)
     - Edge cases (nested lists 3+ deep, complex tables, mixed formatting)
     - Frontmatter variations
     - Known problematic patterns

2. **Validation Approach**
   - Unit tests comparing input → output markdown
   - Visual diff for rendered output
   - Automated CI checks

3. **Debug Infrastructure**
   - Dev-only debug panel showing:
     - Raw input markdown
     - ProseMirror document JSON (internal state)
     - Serialized output markdown
     - Diff highlighting between input/output
   - Console logging for parse/serialize (toggleable)

**Rationale:**
- Catch issues early before they compound
- Debugging visibility reduces troubleshooting time
- Test file becomes regression suite
- Documented limitations prevent user confusion

**Consequences:**
- ✅ High confidence in core functionality
- ✅ Easier debugging throughout development
- ✅ Known limitations documented upfront
- ⚠️ Small time investment before Phase 1

---

#### ADR-011: Phase 1.5 for Polish Items
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:** Phase 1 scope includes Shiki syntax highlighting and theme toggle wiring. These are valuable but could delay core editing features.

**Decision:** Create Phase 1.5 as a brief follow-up sprint for polish items:
- Shiki syntax highlighting
- Theme toggle wiring
- Code block language selector
- Developer experience improvements

**Rationale:**
- Keeps Phase 1 focused on core editing
- Avoids scope creep in main sprint
- Polish items are still done, just sequenced better
- Maintains predictable sprint velocity

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Phase 1 stays focused
- ✅ Clear boundary between "must have" and "polish"
- ⚠️ Slightly more phases to track

---

#### ADR-012: Bundle Size Target
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:** Phase 0 bundle is 732KB. Our principle is "lightweight."

**Decision:** Target <500KB initial bundle by Phase 5, using code-splitting.

**Optimization Strategy:**
1. Analyze with `vite-bundle-visualizer`
2. Lazy-load source view panel
3. Lazy-load Shiki (on first code block)
4. Lazy-load export functionality
5. Consider alternatives if major deps are too heavy

**Rationale:**
- 732KB is acceptable for MVP but not ideal
- Code-splitting is low-risk optimization
- Don't optimize prematurely; wait for Phase 5

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Track issue without blocking progress
- ✅ Clear target for Phase 5
- ⚠️ May need to revisit if bundle grows significantly

---

## 2026-01-29 - Phase 0.5 Complete

### Completion Summary

**Status:** ✅ Round-trip validation complete  
**Test Suite:** 505 lines, 13 sections of GFM elements  
**Result:** Acceptable fidelity with documented transformations

### What Was Built

1. **Test Fixture** - `tests/fixtures/markdown-test-suite.md`
   - Comprehensive GFM coverage (headings, lists, tables, code, links, images)
   - Edge cases (deep nesting, unicode, emoji, whitespace)
   - Validation checklist embedded in document

2. **Debug Panel** - `src/components/Editor/DebugPanel.tsx`
   - Dev-only component (guarded by `import.meta.env.DEV`)
   - Four tabs: Input, Output, Document (ProseMirror JSON), Diff
   - Line-by-line diff visualization
   - Collapsible at bottom of editor

3. **Round-Trip Utility** - `src/utils/roundtrip.ts`
   - `testRoundTrip()` - Compare input/output markdown
   - `formatRoundTripResult()` - Console-friendly output
   - Line difference tracking with stats

4. **Dev Testing API** - Window globals for browser console testing
   - `window.loadTestMarkdown(md)` - Load and track round-trip
   - `window.getMarkdown()` - Get current serialized output
   - `window.editor` - Direct TipTap editor access

### Round-Trip Test Results

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Headings (H1-H6) | ✅ Pass | All levels preserved |
| Text formatting | ✅ Pass | Bold, italic, code, strikethrough |
| Links | ✅ Pass | URLs and titles preserved |
| Images | ✅ Pass | Alt text and titles preserved |
| Lists (nested) | ✅ Pass | 4+ levels work |
| Task lists | ✅ Pass | Checkbox states preserved |
| Blockquotes | ✅ Pass | Nesting preserved |
| Code blocks | ✅ Pass | Language tags preserved |
| Tables | ✅ Pass | Alignment markers preserved |
| Frontmatter | ⚠️ Separate | Handled by `frontmatter.ts` |
| Horizontal rules | ⚠️ Normalized | `***`, `___` → `---` |
| Reference links | ⚠️ Normalized | Converted to inline |
| Hard line breaks | ⚠️ Lost | `  \n` not preserved |
| HTML | ❌ Disabled | By design (`html: false`) |

### Known Transformations (Acceptable)

These are semantic-preserving normalizations:

| Input | Output | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `* item` | `- item` | List marker style (semantic same) |
| `***` or `___` | `---` | Horizontal rule (semantic same) |
| Indented code | Fenced code | More explicit format |
| `[text][ref]` + `[ref]: url` | `[text](url)` | Reference → inline link |

### Action Items for Phase 1

**High Priority:**
- [ ] Add TipTap HardBreak extension for `  \n` support

**Deferred (Acceptable):**
- Reference link preservation (low impact)
- Horizontal rule marker preservation (low impact)
- List marker style preservation (low impact)

### Artifacts

- Test results: `tests/results/phase0.5-roundtrip-results.md`
- Test fixture: `tests/fixtures/markdown-test-suite.md`
- Debug panel: `src/components/Editor/DebugPanel.tsx`
- Round-trip utility: `src/utils/roundtrip.ts`

## Lessons Learned

### 2026-01-29 - Phase 0 Foundation

**What happened:**
Phase 0 completed successfully but revealed that `tiptap-markdown` lacks TypeScript definitions, requiring `@ts-expect-error` workarounds.

**What we learned:**
- Always check npm package typing status before committing to dependencies
- Community TipTap extensions may have gaps in type coverage
- Build passing doesn't mean IDE experience is perfect

**What we'll do differently:**
- Research typing status during tech evaluation
- Consider creating local type declarations for untyped packages
- Document workarounds immediately in code comments

---

### 2026-01-29 - Scope Management

**What happened:**
Reviewer feedback led to creating Phase 0.5 and 1.5 to manage scope.

**What we learned:**
- Validating core assumptions (markdown round-trip) should happen before building features
- Polish items can delay core features if not managed
- Brief follow-up sprints keep main sprints focused

**What we'll do differently:**
- Always validate core dependencies early
- Separate "must have" from "polish" explicitly
- Use .5 phases for validation and polish
